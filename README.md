Mindflow is a large language model for mental health counseling conversations. It is a fine-tuned version of [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) on the [counsel-chat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat) dataset for mental health counseling conversations.


# Motivation

In an era where mental health support is of paramount importance, A large language model fine-tuned on mental health counseling conversations stands as a pioneering solution. Leveraging a diverse dataset of anonymized counseling sessions, the model has been trained to recognize and respond to a wide range of mental health concerns. The fine-tuning process incorporates ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and sensitivity to the nuances of mental health conversations. The resulting model will demonstrate an intricate understanding of mental health issues and provide empathetic and supportive responses.

# Features

# Developer Guide



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
